## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
BB <-read.csv("Final.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#BB[,1:222]
BB_member=subset(BB,BB$Member %in% c('M04158' ,'M08075' ) )
BB_member
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
ncol(BB)
rules = apriori(as.matrix(BB_member[,3:222]), parameter=list(support=0.05, confidence=0.5,minlen=1)) ## the first column in mydata has transaction id


```

```{r}
inspect(rules)
```

```{r}
x<-read.csv("POS DATA-Table 1.csv")
```

```{r}
x_member=subset(x,x$Member %in% c('M04158' ) )
```

```{r}
#x[1:5]

AirlineNW <- graph.edgelist(as.matrix(x_member[,c(1,5)]), directed=TRUE)
```

```{r}
indegree <- degree(AirlineNW,mode="in")
max(indegree)
index <- which(indegree == max(indegree))
str(indegree)
 list(AirlineNW.indegree([0,1]).values())
```

```{r}

```
